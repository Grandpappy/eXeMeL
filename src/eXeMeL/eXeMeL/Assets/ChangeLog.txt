Bug fixes that were caused during the release of the Delve feature

* 4/6/2014 - Saving

Added Save feature.  If a file is opened with eXeMeL then the contents of the window will be saved to the same document.  If the content of the eXeMeL editor did not come from a file, a save dialog is displayed.

Note that the save feature will save the currently active snapshot for the document you have open.

Icon added next to the Editor title that displays if the editor's document was loaded from a file or not.

*4/5/2014 - Delve Feature

Added new Snapshot feature.  This will take a snapshot-in-time of the current document and the undo stack, and push a new version of the document, with the same text, onto the Snapshot stack.  Initially added to support the Delve feature.

Added new Delve feature.  Right click on a block of encoded XML and choose the Delve option.  A new snapshot will be created with the decoded version of the XML that was clicked on.

Added a button next to the Find controls to manually create a snapshot
